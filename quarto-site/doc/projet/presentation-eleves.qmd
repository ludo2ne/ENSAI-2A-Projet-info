## Objectives
- Develop a Python application
- Discover software architecture
- Communicate with a PostgreSQL database
- Use web services
- Design and Model (UML)

:::{.notes}
- Elements covered in lectures and practical work
- PostgreSQL OK, SQLite NO
:::

:::{.notes}
- 3-day immersion
  - Crucial to make significant progress on the project
  - If used well -> 90% of the work done
- Weekly Update: I'll come back to this
:bulb: Get ahead in September
:warning: Absences in project or practical work -> penalty
:::

## 2 Phases
- Analysis / General Design (Sept.)
  - 4 follow-up sessions of 3 hours
  - Mid-October: feedback on the analysis document
- Implementation (Oct. - Nov.)
  - 3 follow-up sessions of 3 hours

:::{.notes}
- You have 1 month for 5 people. A vocational high school student has 6 hours.
If your analysis document is perfect but you haven't started development yet:
:bulb: Advice:
- The most comfortable student creates a POC by September 20
- Then presents the v0 app to the others
Proofread your reports!
:::

## Group Work
- Avoid combining the roles of Project Manager and Tech Lead
- Team spirit
- Notify as soon as possible if something is wrong

:::{.notes}
- Have good behavior
- Some teams will function better than others
- In professional life, you don't always work with your friends
- If you are strong -> don't do everything
- Notify tutor and then professor in case of issues
No need to say once the project is finished:
- I did everything
- Another member did nothing
:::

## Follow-up
- Weekly Update
- To be filled every week
  - By Thursday evening at the latest

::: {.callout-note}
More details in the [student notice](./notice-eleves.qmd#point-hebdo){target="_blank"}.
:::

:::{.notes}
- As in professional life
- Mandatory, otherwise penalty
- Show Model
- "Nothing to report" if you haven't done anything
:::

## Work Environment
::: {.callout-important}

You have all the necessary tools to code on the VM or a datalab (better). 
If you are not very comfortable with IT, it will be almost impossible to code outside the VM/datalab.
**No help will be provided to install the necessary tools if you are outside the VM.**

:::

- We expect **[quality]{.underline}** code
- Documentation is mandatory for each class and each method

:::{.notes}
Follow Python development best practices:
- Class names in CamelCase
- Files in snake_case
- Meaningful variable and method names
:::

## Test Your Code
- Unit tests are mandatory
- Code in small chunks

:::{.notes}
- Methods that don't work because they call methods that don't work
:::

## Template
- [Example of a simple project](https://github.com/ludo2ne/ENSAI-2A-projet-info-template){target="_blank"}

:::{.notes}
- data, doc, src
- config files: logs, cov, requirements, gitignore
- README: instructions to install and run
- .vscode: vscode setup
- CI: explain the principle
