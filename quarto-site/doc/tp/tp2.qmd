## Before you start {.unnumbered}

This tutorial combines explanations and code phases.

The explanations in this tutorial should not take precedence over those of your teacher. Take them as a knowledge base for later, but always prefer oral explanations.

::: {.callout-note title="Concepts covered"}
- OOP reminder
- Unit tests
- Business objects
- Strategy design pattern
:::


## What you will be coding

Our game will be inspired by *Pokémon Unite* (no knowledge of the game or *Pokémon* is necessary).

In a nutshell, there will be *Pokemons* competing in *Battles* by throwing *Attacks*.


### Business objects

You're going to create **business objects** for a *Pokémon* game.

::: {.callout-note title="Business object"}
A business object is a representation of a specific entity in the context of a business application. It encapsulates the data and behaviour associated with that entity and is often used to model real-world concepts in the application domain.

This leads to objects containing mainly attributes and very few methods other than *getter* and *setter*.
:::

Another example, here are the business objects for a simple application that manages bike hire:

- **Bike**: Represents a bike (id, type, model...)
- **Customer**: Represents a person (id, surname, first name, etc.)
- **Rental**: Represents a rental transaction (id, Client, Bike, start, end, amount, etc.)


### The application's business objects

- `Pokemon`: which have various characteristics and statistics
  - a name
  - a level
  - [a type](https://www.nationhive.com/fr/jeux/pokemon-unite/guide/roles-des-pokemon){target="_blank"}
    - here the types are : Attacker, Defender, Versatile, Helper and Fast (and not: Fire, Water, Plant...)
  - statistics contained in a *Statistic* object defined below
- `Statistic`: to avoid overloading the Pokemon class, their stats are stored in an object of the Statistic class.
  - hp: health points
  - attack, defense, speed... which are used to determine the strength of its attacks
- `Attack`: different types of attack available to Pokemons (part 3)
- `Battle`: used to confront 2 Pokemons to determine the outcome of the battle (part 4)

### Class diagram

Here is a very simplified class diagram of the main classes to be coded during these practical sessions.

```{mermaid}
classDiagram
  class Pokemon {
    # _name : str
    # _level : int
    # _type : str
    # _current_stat : Statistic
    + get_pokemon_attack_coef() float
  }
 
  class Statistic {
    - __hp : int
    - __attack : int
    - __defense : int
    - __sp_atk : int
    - __sp_def : int
    - __speed : int
  }

  class Attack{
    # _name : str
    # _power : int
    # _description : str
    + compute_damage(Pokemon, Pokemon) int
  }

  class Battle{
    - first_monstie : Pokemon
    - second_monstie : Pokemon
    - winner : Pokemon
  }

  Pokemon o-- Statistic : possesses
  Pokemon o-- Attack : uses
  Battle o.."2" Pokemon : call
```


## Get the code

At the end of the course, don't forget to:

- Save your work using Git
- Delete or pause your VSCode service

### Launch VScode

::: {.callout-important title="Custom VSCode service"}
You [should not launch]{.underline} a standard VSCode-python service, but rather a customised version.
:::

- [ ] Login to a Datalab
  - <https://onyxia.lab.groupe-genes.fr/>{target="_blank"}
  - <https://datalab.sspcloud.fr/>{target="_blank"} 
- [ ] Go to the [Tools page](./tools.qmd){target="_blank"}
  - It explains why we are going to use a customised service
- [ ] Launch a [**customised**]{.underline} VSCode service


### Fork or update your forked repo

The TP code can be found on this GitHub repository: [ENSAI-2A-complement-info-TP](https://github.com/ludo2ne/ENSAI-2A-complement-info-TP){target="_blank"}.

- [ ] Login to [GitHub](https://github.com/){target="_blank"}


```{.python}
repository_already_forked = "Did you fork it on TP1?"

if repository_already_forked:
```

:::::: {.columns}

::: {.callout-tip title="Fork a repository"}
A fork is a personal copy of another user's repository. 

This allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project, and then propose your modifications back to the original repository via a pull request if desired.
:::

### Clone

In your VSCode service:

- [ ] Open a **Git Bash** terminal
- [ ] Clone with *https* your forked repository
- [ ] Open Folder
  - File > Open Folder > `/home/onyxia/work/<repo_name>` > OK
  - Or using command: `code-server ENSAI-2A-complement-info-TP`



## Modelling and implementation

Initially, we're going to work only on the `Pokemons` (the `Statistic` class has already been coded).

Before writing any code, we're going to think about the best possible design for our Pokémons. Our design will try as far as possible to respect the following rule: **low coupling, high cohesion**.

In other words, we will try to make :

- classes that are **as disjoint as possible** (*low coupling*) so that a modification to one class does not require us to modify the others
- while trying to have in each class **tasks that are as linked as possible** (*strong cohesion*).


### First approach: if/elif/else

- [ ] Open the `Pokemon` class

We're interested in the *get_pokemon_attack_coef()* method, which will be used to determine the power of the attack according to the type of *Pokemon*.

- [ ] Explain why an implementation based on `if/elif/else` for types is a bad idea? 
  - Imagine if there were several similar blocks of code in our application, and we had to add a new type


### The power of OOP

Instead of externalising the behaviour of our *Pokemons*, we're going to put all their specific behaviour into child classes of a `Pokemon` superclass. This is made possible by two properties of OOP objects:

- **inheritance**: it's possible to specialise an existing class by modifying its behaviour, or by adding new ones.
- **polymorphism**: two functions can have the same name but different behaviours

Furthermore, as each of our *Pokemons* will necessarily be of a type, none of them will simply be of the `Pokemon` class, which allows us to make this class *abstract*. By clearly defining our abstract class, we'll have :

- A blueprint for all the classes that inherit from it. This has the following advantages:
  - Provides information on how the code is structured
  - Automatically generate the methods to be defined
  - Limits bugs. If a method is forgotten, the code crashes on start-up, which prevents unexpected behaviour that is difficult to detect.
- A single **interface** for all *Pokemon* types. Whatever the type of *Pokemon*, it will be considered as an `AbstractPokemon` everywhere in the code.

---

- [ ] Transform the `Pokemon` class into an abstract class `AbstractPokemon`
  - rename the file to *abstract_pokemon.py* as well
- [ ] Turn the *get_pokemon_attack_coef()* method into an abstract method
- [ ] Create the `AttackerPokemon`, `DefenderPokemon` and `AllRounderPokemon` classes, which inherit from `AbstractPokemon`
- [ ] In these 3 classes, implement the required method

You should end up with a tree structure similar to this one:

```{.txt}
ENSAI-2A-COMPLEMENTS-INFO-TP
    └── src
        └── business_object
            ├── pokemon
            │   ├── abstract_pokemon.py
            │   ├── attacker_pokemon.py
            │   ├── defender_pokemon.py
            │   └── all_rounder_pokemon.py
            └── statistic.py
```

::: {.callout-tip title="Help" collapse="true"}
To make an abstract class, use the `abc` package.

Here's an example of what's expected:

```{.python filename="abstract_personnage.py"}
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class AbstractPersonnage(ABC):
    def __init__(self, phrase_attaque:str, phrase_defense:str):
        self._phrase_attaque = phrase_attaque
        self._phrase_defense = phrase_defense
       
    @abstractmethod  # decorator that defines a method as abstract
    def damages(self) -> int:
        pass
```

```{.python filename="magicien.py"}
from abstract_personnage import AbstractPersonnage

class Magicien(AbstractPersonnage):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("Throw a fireball", "Use a magic barrier")
       
    def damages(self) -> int:
        return 10
```
:::

To help you, here is the target class diagram:

```{mermaid}
classDiagram
  class AbstractPokemon {
    <<abstract>>
    # _name : str
    # _level : int
    # _type : str
    # _current_stat : Statistic
    + get_pokemon_attack_coef() float
  }
 
  class Statistic {
    - __hp : int
    - __attack : int
    - __defense : int
    - __sp_atk : int
    - __sp_def : int
    - __speed : int
  }
 
  AbstractPokemon <|-- AttackerPokemon
  AbstractPokemon <|-- DefenderPokemon
  AbstractPokemon <|-- AllRounderPokemon
  AbstractPokemon o-- Statistic
```


### Test your code

You are going to test the method *get_pokemon_attack_coef()*.

- [ ] Create unit tests in classes `AttackerPokemon` and `AllRounderPokemon` classes.
- [ ] Run unit tests

To do this, you will use the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/){target="_blank"} package in python.

Examples of commands to run unit tests:

- `pytest`
- `pytest --tb=short` to display a short, summarised trace
- `pytest --maxfail=1` to stop at the first failure
- `pytest -v` v: verbose, for more details

An example of a test is given in the `TestDefenderPokemon` class. As a reminder, a test breaks down into 3 parts:

- **GIVEN**: create the objects needed to run the test
- **WHEN**: call the method to be tested
- **THEN**: check the result

The test classes will be organised as follows, reproducing the architecture of your application:

```{.txt}
ENSAI-2A-COMPLEMENTS-INFO-TP
    └── src
        ├── business_object
        │   ├── pokemon
        │   │   ├── abstract_pokemon.py
        │   │   ├── attacker_pokemon.py
        │   │   ├── defender_pokemon.py
        │   │   └── all_rounder_pokemon.py
        │   └── statistic.py
        └── test
            └── test_business_object
                └── test_pokemon
                    ├── test_attacker_pokemon.py
                    ├── test_defender_pokemon.py
                    └── test_all_rounder_pokemon.py
```

::: {.callout-caution title="If you encounter import issues"}
- Check that the parent folder in the VSCode explorer is : **ENSAI-2A-complement-info-TP**
- Use full import paths rather than relative paths
  - the path root is set in the `src` folder
  - example: `from business_object.pokemon.abstract_pokemon import AbstractPokemon`
- Create `__init__.py` files (empty)
  - in ALL the folders you create
  - it's a bit of a pain but it can unblock the situation
:::


- [ ] Can you test the *level_up()* method directly on an `AbstractPokemon`?
- [ ] Create a commit and push your code


## Aggregation, the other way of adding flexibility to code

Now that our Pokémons are done, we're going to add the attacks.

Our system will have to respect certain constraints:

- Several types of attack will co-exist, each with a different way of calculating damage:
  - Variable damage attacks divided into 2 types:
    - **Physical attacks**, which use the Pokémon's attack and defence
    - **Special attacks**, which use the Pokémon's special attack and special defence
  - **Fixed damage attacks**, which do a fixed amount of damage.
- A Pokémon can have several attacks, and the type of attack must be transparent to the Pokémon.


### Fixed damage attacks

We'll start with fixed damage attacks. As there will be another type of attack, all attacks will inherit from the `AbstractAttack` class. This class has the abstract method *compute_damage()* which will need to be implemented in the child classes.

```{mermaid}
classDiagram

  class AbstractAttack{
    <<abstract>>
    # _power : int
    # _name : str
    # _description : str
    + compute_damage(APkm, APkm)$  int
  }

   class FixedDamageAttack{
    + compute_damage(APkm,APkm)  int
   }
 
   AbstractAttack <|-- FixedDamageAttack
```

- [ ] Create class `AbstractAttack`
- [ ] Implement the `FixedDamageAttack` class
  - class and its *compute_damage()* method, which will simply return the *power* of the attack.
- [ ] Create unit tests to check that everything is working correctly

### Variable damage attacks

Next we're going to code the variable damage attacks. They use the following formula:

$$Damage = \biggl( \frac{(\frac{2 \times Level}{5}+2) \times Power \times Att}{Def \times 50} +2\biggl) \times random$$


with:

- $Att$: equal to either the attack or special attack of the attacking Pokemon
- $Def$: equal to either the defence or special defence of the defending Pokemon
- $Power$: the attack's power value
- $random$ : a value in the range [0.85; 1]

::: {.callout-important}
The only difference between physical and special attacks is the coefficients $Att$ and $Def$.

The rest of the damage formula is identical. So we're going to use the *template method* design pattern, the UML model of which is as follows.
:::

```{mermaid}
classDiagram

  class AbstractAttack{
    <<abstract>>
    # _power : int
    # _name : str
    # _description : str
    + compute_damage(APkm, APkm)$  int
  }

   class FixedDamageAttack{
    + compute_damage(APkm,APkm )  int
   }

  class AbstractFormulaAttack{
    <<abstract>>
    -get_attack_stat(APkm)$  float
    -get_defense_stat(APkm)$  float
    +compute_damage(APkm,APkm)  int
  }
 
  class PhysicalFormulaAttack{
    -get_attack_stat(APkm)  float
    -get_defense_stat(APkm)  float
  }
 
  class SpecialFormulaAttack{
    -get_attack_stat(APkm)  float
    -get_defense_stat(APkm)  float
  }
 
   AbstractAttack <|-- FixedDamageAttack
   AbstractAttack <|-- AbstractFormulaAttack
   AbstractFormulaAttack <|-- SpecialFormulaAttack
   AbstractFormulaAttack <|-- PhysicalFormulaAttack
```

The `AbstractFormulaAttack` class will contain the methods :

- **compute_damage()**
  - This method will contain the formula for calculating damage
  - It will call the *get_attack_stat()* and *get_defense_stat()* methods to find out which statistics to use
- **get_attack_stat()** and **get_defense_stat()** (abstract). 
  - These methods will need to be implemented in the child classes to determine which statistics to use

---

- [ ] Implement the 3 new classes
- [ ] Create unit tests to check that everything is working properly


## Final architecture

::: {.callout-note title="Bonus"}
If you have time!
:::


We are now going to reattach the ends to create our final architecture:

```{mermaid}
classDiagram
  class AbstractPokemon {
    <<abstract>>
    # _current_stat : Statistique
    # _level : int
    # _name : str
    # _attack_list : List~AbstractAttack~
    +get_pokemon_attack_coef()$  float
    +level_up() None
  }
 
  class Statistique {
    - hp : int
    - attaque : int
    - defense : int
    - spe_atk : int
    - spe_def : int
    - vitesse : int
  }
   
  class BattleService {
    + resolve_battle(APkm, APkm) : Battle
    + get_order(APkm, APkm)
    + choose_attack(APkm) : AAttack
  }  
  
  class Battle{
    - first_monstie : APkm
    - second_monstie : APkm
    - winner : APkm
    - rounds : List<Round>
  }

  class Round{
    attacker: APkm
    defender: APkm
    dealt_damage: int
    attack_description: str
  }
  BattleService ..>"2" AbstractPokemon : use
  AbstractPokemon <|-- Attacker
  AbstractPokemon <|-- Defender
  AbstractPokemon <|-- AllRounder
  Statistique --* AbstractPokemon

  Battle .. BattleService
  Battle .. Round
 
  class AbstractAttack{
    <<abstract>>
    # _power : int
    # _name : str
    # _description : str
    +compute_damage(APkm, APkm)$ int
  }

  class FixedDamageAttack{
    + compute_damage(APkm,APkm )  int
  }

  class AbstractFormulaAttack{
    <<abstract>>
    -get_attack_stat(APkm)$  float
    -get_defense_stat(APkm)$  float
    + compute_damage(APkm,APkm ) int
  }
 
  class PhysicalFormulaAttack{
   -get_attack_stat(APkm)$  float
   -get_defense_stat(APkm)$  float
  }
 
  class SpecialFormulaAttack{
    -get_attack_stat(APkm)  float
    -get_defense_stat(APkm)  float
  }
 
  AbstractAttack <|-- FixedDamageAttack
  AbstractAttack <|-- AbstractFormulaAttack
  AbstractFormulaAttack <|-- SpecialFormulaAttack
  AbstractFormulaAttack <|-- PhysicalFormulaAttack
  BattleService >.. AbstractAttack  : use
  AbstractPokemon o-->"0..*" AbstractAttack

```

- [ ] Implement the class diagram above
- [ ] Test your code by writing new unit tests

This architecture makes it possible to decorrelate pokemon attacks and specify the behaviour of attacks as they are inherited. The advantages are:

- For the `AbstractPokemon` class, all attacks are `AbstractAttacks`. As long as they expose the *compute_damage()* method, our program will work. This makes it easy to add new types of attack.
- A *Pokémon* can have any type of attack.
- We can add a status system such as paralysis or poison quite easily. To do this, we need to modify the `AbstractAttack` class and the classes that inherit from it. This is potentially time-consuming, but doesn't require any changes to the “Pokémon” part of our architecture.
- One person could concentrate on creating *Pokémons*, while another could concentrate on creating attacks without difficulty. The two parts of the code are relatively independent, the only area of coupling being the `AbstractPokemon` and `AbstractAttack` classes, which are used above all to define what must be done by the daughter classes and what is accessible to the outside.

Externalizing the behaviour of attacks into specific classes and then linking them to Pokémon via a fairly flexible aggregation relationship that allows a Pokémon's attacks to be changed dynamically is the *strategy* design pattern.
