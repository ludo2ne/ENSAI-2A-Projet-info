## Instructions

- In the lab instructions, [**you have to replace**]{.underline} `<...>` with an appropriate value.

::: {.callout-tip title="Example"}
- `git commit -m "<explicit message>"` 
- :arrow_right: `git commit -m "fix: log in error"`
:::

- Don't skip a step that didn't work, telling yourself that it doesn't matter. This may cause problems later on.

## Exercices repository

- [ENSAI-2A-complement-info-TP](https://github.com/ludo2ne/ENSAI-2A-complement-info-TP){target="_blank"}
- Create a [fork](https://github.com/ludo2ne/ENSAI-2A-complement-info-TP/fork){target="_blank"} of this repository


## Datalabs

::: {.callout-important}
You require resources to start your services, the datalabs are available for that purpose. 

Once you have completed your tasks, make sure to [free up these resources]{.underline} by deleting or pausing your services.

### Custom service

URLs to launch custom VSCode-python services for:

- [SSPCloud](https://datalab.sspcloud.fr/launcher/ide/vscode-python?name=vscode-python&version=2.3.17&s3=region-79669f20&init.personalInit=«https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fludo2ne%2FTP0-datalab%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmain%2Ftestinit.sh»&networking.user.enabled=true&autoLaunch=true)
- GENES Datalab

:construction:

In these labs, we will need a customised VSCode service, different from the one offered in the catalogue:

- by installing additional Python packages
- by modifying certain extensions
  - using :heavy_plus_sign: Ruff instead of :heavy_minus_sign: Flake8 to format the code
- by opening a specific port to deploy an API


There are several ways to customise a service:

- Launch the catalogue service, then modify it by executing commands manually
- Use an initialisation script that will run immediately after the catalogue service is launched
  - In the form before Launch: Initialization scripts
- Create and use a Docker image based on the original service
  - In the form before Launch: Service > Use a custom image

```{.bash}
pip install inquirerPy psycopg2-binary pytest python-dotenv tabulate

code-server --install-extension charliermarsh.ruff
code-server --uninstall-extension ms-python.flake8
```

::: {.callout-important}
Opening the port to deploy the API must be done before launching the service; after that, it is too late, and you will have to delete it and start over.

## VSCode

### Open Folder

File > Open Folder > `/home/onyxia/work/<repo_name>` > OK

::: {.callout-caution}
Open Folder allows you to determine the root folder you are currently in.

To find out the current folder, look at the top left of the [explorer]{.underline} for the parent folder.

This choice is very important because imports between Python modules use relative paths.
